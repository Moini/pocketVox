Description: Desktop vocal control
 PocketVox is both an application and a library written in C
 by Benoit Franquet. It uses Pocketsphinx to do voice recognition.
 The voice recognition is done offline and doesn't need an Internet connection.
 Its aim is to provide an efficient way to integrate voice recognition
 on the Linux desktop. More particularly, its main goal is to give
 to visual impaired a powerful tool to control their desktop.
